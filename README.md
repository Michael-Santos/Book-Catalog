# Book-Catalog
Practicing some Angular JS building a catalog of books to help me to organize my poor bookshelf (useless)


## How to run this application
At this moment you need to manually create a test server to run the application. You cant do this installing `http-server` running the following command (You need already to have configured nodejs  at this point):

    `npm install -g http-server`

At this point the "server" is already installed so you need to run this command under root folder:

    `http-server ./src`

Have fun!... with this bookshelf organizer useless :no_mouth:
